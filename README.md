# Macroenometrics (44343). 4th topic: VAR models

Hi students\!

This is the repo for the 4th topic of the 2019-2020 Macroeconomerics
course from the Master in Economics at the University of Valencia.
Mariam has delivered already the first 3 topics and I’m in charge of the
last and 4th: **VAR models**.

As you know the classes were face-to-face but then the covid-19 … I hope
all this will pass soon. We will try our best lo learn something about
VAR models\!\!

I’m writing a friendlier and more helpful website at the moment. It has
more information but without all the weird GitHub stuff\!

The website is here: <https://perezp44.github.io/prueba_deply_Distill/>
